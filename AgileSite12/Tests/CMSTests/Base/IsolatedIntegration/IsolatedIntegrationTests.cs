    /// The master database is created using SQL scripts from the solution. For each modification of this folder a new master database is created.
    /// The master database is detached after it has been created and its files are copied to create an instance database that a running test will use.

    /// The instance database is removed when a test finishes and a master database, that is out of date, is removed automatically.
